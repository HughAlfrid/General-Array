The problem that this code solves is to implement a generic ArrayList data structure in Java. An ArrayList is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed. This implementation allows storing elements of any data type (generic) and provides methods to add, remove, get, and manipulate the elements in the list.
Problem-solving approach:
1. Defining the Data Structure: The code defines a generic class MyArrayList<E>, where E represents the type of elements that can be stored in the list. It uses an array data to store the elements and an integer variable size to keep track of the number of elements currently in the list.
2. Constructor: The constructor initializes the list with a maximum capacity of 100 elements (MAXELEMENTS). It sets the size to 0 initially, as there are no elements in the list when it is created.
3. Adding an Element: The add method allows adding an element at a specified index in the list. It first checks if the index is within the valid range. If not, it throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException. It then shifts the elements to the right to make space for the new element and inserts it at the specified index.
4. Checking for Element Existence: The contains method checks if a given object exists in the list. It iterates through the elements in the list and uses the equals method to compare each element with the target object. If a match is found, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
5. Getting an Element: The get method retrieves an element at a specified index in the list. It checks if the index is within the valid range and throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException if not. Otherwise, it returns the element at the specified index.
6. Removing an Element: The remove method removes an element at a specified index from the list. It first checks if the index is within the valid range and throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException if not. Then, it shifts the elements to the left to fill the gap created by removing the element and decrements the size variable.
7. Clearing the List: The clear method resets the list by setting the size to 0, effectively removing all elements from the list.
8. Filtering the List: The filter method filters the elements in the list based on a low and high range. It creates a temporary array temp to store the filtered elements and iterates through the list. If an element is within the specified range, it is added to the temp array. Finally, the original data array is replaced with the filtered temp array, and the size is updated accordingly.
9. Sorting the List: The sortList method sorts the elements in the list in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm. It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order until the entire list is sorted.
10. Printing the List: The toString method provides a string representation of the list elements in the format [element1, element2, ...].
The code offers a basic implementation of an ArrayList with generic support, allowing users to store elements of different types, manipulate the list, and perform sorting and filtering operations on the elements. However, it is important to note that the code has some limitations, such as a fixed maximum capacity (MAXELEMENTS) and the potential inefficiency of the Bubble Sort algorithm for large lists. For production use, more advanced data structures and algorithms could be considered.
